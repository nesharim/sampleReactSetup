# sampleReactSetup
It started of as a setup, however, I have added a simple implemntation with redux and react to fetch data from git

Instructions to run this:
After cloning the porject to your local, 
1. yarn install
2. yarn run build
3. yarn run dev // To start the server on port 8080

TODO:
1. Add CSS
2. Make the overall feel of the page better to look at.
3. Add search capibility for the repo names.
